    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Thesse espresso chocolate chip cookies are for all the cookie lovers out there! Combine the perfect esprosso taste with a chocalte chip cookie. You won't be able to stop a 1!
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/3 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 tsp of pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups of all purpose flower</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>3 tsp of espresso powder</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups of choclate chips</li>
            <li>Flakey salt (optional)</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper</li>
            <li>Beat butter and sugars for several minutes, until light and fluffy. Add egg and vanilla and beat until combined, scraping the bowl as needed.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and espresso powder.</li>
            <li>Add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture and mix on low speed until just combined. Stir in 1 cup of chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>Scoop the dough into 1½tablespoon balls (I use a cookie scoop) and place on the prepared baking sheets. Mound the balls higher rather than wider so that they bake with a nice thickness. Using the remaining ½ cup of chocolate chips, press several chocolate chips onto the tops of the mounds of dough (this will help the chocolate chips be more visible). You can proceed with baking right away, or for thicker cookies you can chill the dough balls in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Bake for 9-12 minutes, until the edges are set but the centers of the cookies are still under baked. See note below about shaping the cookies immediately after baking.</li>
            <li>Place the baking sheets on wire racks and cool completely. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt, if desired. The cookies will firm up as they cool.</li>

        </ol>
